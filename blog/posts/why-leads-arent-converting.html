        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The 7 Biggest Reasons Leads Don't Convert</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. No One Follows Up Within 60 Seconds</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> 75% of sales teams wait more than 1 hour to contact a lead. By then, the prospect has moved on, called a competitor, or forgotten why they were interested.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The AI Fix:</strong> Automated systems respond within 60 seconds. The lead stays engaged and your reps get the first chance to pitch.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Unqualified Leads Waste Sales Rep Time</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> Your reps spend hours on leads that aren't ready to buy. Wrong company size, wrong industry, no budget.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The AI Fix:</strong> AI screening qualifies leads before your reps spend time. Only high-value leads get rep attention.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Inconsistent Sales Messaging</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> Different reps pitch differently. Some focus on price, others on features. Inconsistent messaging confuses prospects.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The AI Fix:</strong> AI-trained reps deliver consistent, optimized messaging. Every prospect gets the same effective pitch.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Poor Objection Handling</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> Reps freeze when prospects raise objections. They lack product knowledge or sales technique to overcome them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The AI Fix:</strong> AI reps are trained on every objection. They know exactly how to respond and move the deal forward.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Leads Fall Through the Cracks</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> Manual follow-up sequences fail. Someone forgets to send the email, the call doesn't get scheduled, the deal stalls.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The AI Fix:</strong> Automated workflows ensure nothing is missed. Every follow-up happens on schedule. Every lead gets nurtured.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">6. Wrong Sales Approach for the Prospect</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> Aggressive reps scare away consultative buyers. Passive reps fail to close deal-ready prospects.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The AI Fix:</strong> AI adapts to each prospect's style. Consultative if they need education. Aggressive if they're ready to close.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7. Leads Aren't Followed Up At All</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> 48% of sales teams don't follow up after the first contact. One "no" and the lead is abandoned.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          <strong>The AI Fix:</strong> Systematic follow-up sequences ensure every lead gets 3-5+ touches. Many convert on the 3rd or 4th attempt.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The AI Solution: Speed + Consistency + Persistence</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          AI-powered sales teams solve ALL of these problems simultaneously:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-3 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Respond within 60 seconds (391% better conversion)</li>
          <li><strong>Qualification:</strong> Pre-qualify before rep time is wasted</li>
          <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Same effective message every time</li>
          <li><strong>Expertise:</strong> Trained on all objections and sales techniques</li>
          <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Automatic follow-up sequences that never fail</li>
          <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Handle 10x more leads with the same effort</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Real Impact: Numbers Don't Lie</h2>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300">
          Leads aren't converting because of delays, inconsistency, and lack of persistence. AI fixes all three. If you're losing deals, it's probably because you're not reaching out fast enough—or at all.
