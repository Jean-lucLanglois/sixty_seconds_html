      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">4. Data Protection &amp; Privacy</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">We are committed to protecting your data in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Contact and engagement data processed through our Service is maintained with industry-standard security measures. For mid-size teams managing multiple CRM accounts and contact lists, we provide role-based access controls to ensure data governance. Please refer to our <a href="/privacy_policy.html" class="underline text-accent hover:brightness-110">Privacy Policy</a> for comprehensive details on data collection, use, and retention practices. Organizations are responsible for obtaining appropriate consent from contacts before uploading their information to the Service.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">All content, materials, software, and services provided by 1 Minute Sales, including but not limited to AI-generated scripts, proposal templates, reporting tools, and platform infrastructure, are the exclusive property of 1 Minute Sales or its licensors. You may use these materials solely as permitted by this Agreement and applicable laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, transmit, or create derivative works without explicit written permission. Your use of our Service grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to access and use the platform for authorized business purposes only.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">6. User-Generated Content</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">Any data, communications, or content you input into the Service remains your property. However, by using our Service, you grant us a non-exclusive license to process and analyze such content to improve our offerings, including AI model training (unless opted out). You warrant that you own or have permission to use any customer data, contact information, or business content uploaded to the platform.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">7. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">1 Minute Sales integrates with third-party platforms including HubSpot, Pipedrive, and Zoho. Your use of these integrations is subject to the terms of service of those respective providers. We are not responsible for third-party service availability, changes to their APIs, or discontinuation of their services. Any data shared with third-party platforms is governed by their privacy policies and terms of service.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">8. Service Availability &amp; Support</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">While we strive for high availability, we do not guarantee uninterrupted access to the Service. We regularly perform maintenance and updates that may temporarily impact availability. For organizations on PRO and TEAM plans, we offer dedicated support and account management to address integration questions, onboarding assistance, and feature utilization. Standard response times apply based on your service tier.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300 uppercase text-sm leading-relaxed">To the fullest extent permitted by law, 1 Minute Sales shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Service, including but not limited to loss of revenue, profits, data, or business opportunity, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">10. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300 uppercase text-sm leading-relaxed">The Service is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. We make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the Service's accuracy, completeness, or suitability for a particular purpose. We do not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements, be error-free, uninterrupted, or secure.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">11. Indemnification</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">You agree to indemnify and hold harmless 1 Minute Sales, its officers, employees, and agents from any claims, losses, or damages arising from your use of the Service, your violation of this Agreement, or your violation of applicable laws. This includes any claims by third parties regarding content you upload or actions you take on the platform.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">12. Payment Terms &amp; Subscription Renewals</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">Pricing and billing terms are as stated in your service agreement or on our pricing page. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 7 days before the renewal date. Organizations may customize billing cycles and account allocations through the administrative console. For multi-user or enterprise arrangements, please contact our sales team for custom pricing and terms.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">13. Termination</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time. Upon termination, your access to the Service will cease immediately. You remain responsible for any outstanding fees through the end of your paid term. We may terminate or suspend your account if you violate this Agreement or engage in prohibited conduct. Upon request, we will provide reasonable notice before suspension, except in cases of severe violations or security concerns.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">14. Compliance &amp; Regulatory Requirements</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">You are responsible for ensuring your use of the Service complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, as well as industry-specific regulations (including but not limited to GDPR, CCPA, and TCPA). For organizations in regulated industries, additional compliance measures may be required. We encourage mid-size enterprises to review applicable regulations with legal counsel.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">15. Changes to Terms &amp; Service</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">We may update these terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via email or platform notification. Continued use of the Service following notification of changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms. For long-term contracts or custom agreements, changes may be subject to amendment procedures outlined in your agreement.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">16. Data Retention &amp; Backup</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">We maintain regular backups of platform data. However, you are responsible for maintaining independent backups of any critical business data. Upon account termination, data may be retained for a limited period as required by law, after which it will be securely deleted.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">17. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">Any disputes arising from this Agreement shall first be addressed through good-faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration or court proceedings as permitted by applicable law. Both parties agree to attempt mediation before pursuing litigation.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">18. Entire Agreement</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">This Agreement, along with any executed service agreements, privacy policies, and supplementary terms, constitutes the entire agreement between you and 1 Minute Sales regarding the Service. Any prior negotiations, understandings, or agreements are superseded by this document.</p>
